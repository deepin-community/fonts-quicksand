Description: sans-serif font with round attributes
 Quicksand is a display sans serif with rounded terminals.
 The project was initiated by Andrew Paglinawan in 2008 using
 geometric shapes as a core foundation. It is designed for
 display purposes but kept legible enough to use in small sizes
 as well.
 .
 In 2016, in collaboration with Andrew, it was thoroughly revised
 by Thomas Jockin to improve the quality.
